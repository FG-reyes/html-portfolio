 <h1>My Top Three Movies</h1>
 <h2>Favorite Marvel Movies and Series</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Spider-man No Way Home</h3>
 <p>The three spideys got together to save the world<br/>
    They fought the green goblin, sandman and electro from the previous movies<br/>
 </p>
 <h3>The Loki Series</h3>
 <p>The little bad brother of Thor have to save the multiverse<br/>
    He sacrifices his life for the sake of others, to see his purpose<br/>
 </p>
 <h3>The Avengers Infinity Saga</h3>
 <p>This movie really have me a roller coaster emotion<br/>
    From having an unexplainable excitement because they all got together<br/>
    Until someone breaks my heart because Iron Man dies when he snaps <br/>
